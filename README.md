# 🌳 Merkle-DEQ Data Store

**Merkle-DEQ Data Store** is a hybrid storage engine that  
1. Organizes data in a Merkle tree for tamper-proof integrity and compact proofs  
2. Models retrieval paths and partial reconstruction via a differential-equation framework

This module lets you both validate data inclusion with Merkle proofs and “solve” for missing branches or aggregate state using differential equations, blending cryptographic structures with continuous‐math retrieval.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Merkle Tree Storage**  
  Store any JSON-serializable records in a Merkle tree. Get root hashes, inclusion proofs, and compact summaries.

- 🔄 **DEQ-Based Retrieval**  
  Model retrieval or aggregation tasks as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Automatically reconstruct or interpolate missing subtrees by “solving” the tree dynamics.

- 📦 **Compact Proofs & State**  
  Generate minimal Merkle proofs for inclusion/exclusion. Maintain a continuous “state vector” for rapid batch queries via ODE solvers.

- 🧩 **Pluggable Backends**  
  Swap in-memory, file-system, or database backends for both the Merkle store and the DEQ engine.

- ⚙️ **CLI & API**  
  Command-line tool for store/verify/retrieve operations, plus a Python API for integration.
